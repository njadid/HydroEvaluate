# HydroEvaluate
Hydrologic model evaluations in python

For now you need to change the code for your own data and data sources.
Take a look at the code and change the directories to your own directories. 
Change variable and simulation names.
This process will be simplified soon!

I am doing the calculations for all the metrics but you can modify the code for calculating less metrics.

For now, user needs to modify the code to be able to use it.
Later, I will make it more flexible.
